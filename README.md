Python-Workshop
===============

PrincetonPy's one-day workshop, **Introduction to Python for Scientific Computing**.

The material comes as a series of IPython Notebooks :

- 0. **Introduction and Setup** - a brief introduction to what Python is about, and some recommendations for 
what to install.
- 1. **Basic Python** - very quick intro to variables, control structure, lists, dictionaries, functions, IO; 
to 
get you on your feet.
- 2. **Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib** - the *Scipy Stack* which forms the basis of scientific coding in Python.
- 3. **Demos** - lmfit, scikit-learn, scikit-image, pandas, pickle, pymc; some packages I use for cool 
scientific work.

Exercises occur throughout, with tips and solutions given. For all questions, please get in 
touch either on our [forums](http://princetonpy.com) or on Twitter at @PrincetonPy.
